Features :
  Cutting down ssh connections and https encrypted connections in order to find footprints of the hacker's computer
  
Warning:
 I can't take any responsibility if you used this IDS in cyber attacking.
 Don't use the pkt-change command! The IDS will ARP Storm and ICMP Strom your network!
